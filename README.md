# Taxi-Tip-Classifier

Takes taxi tip data from Kaggle and combines it with weather data from the National Centers for Environmental Information. Using these two data sets, we create extra features that we can feed into a classification algorithm that will predict if a taxi driver receives a "high", "medium" or "low" tip.
